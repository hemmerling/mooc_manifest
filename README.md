# MOOC Manifesto ( Manifesto for Massive Open Online Courses )

We believe that free education and free acccess to information is the base of humanity.

If an educational service offers a "Massive Open Online Course" according to this Manifesto,
both access to the course contents and tests ( including quizzes and assignments ) should be free to everybody.
