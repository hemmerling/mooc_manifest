# MOOC Manifesto ( Manifesto for Massive Open Online Courses )

We believe that free education and free acccess to information is the base of humanity.

If an educational service offers a "Massive Open Online Course" according to this Manifesto,
both access to the course contents and tests ( including quizzes and assignments ) should be free to everybody.

If MOOC course participation is liable to pay costs at all, then just for a final graduation certification document.
The calculation of a moderate fee for this certification document should consider:
- MOOC online services are based on software running unattended, with minimal costs and without human interaction.
- The MOOC platform software is not state-of-the-art or leading-edge, but standard. Its not rocket science, but mostly simple and stupid ( mulitple choice tests, course system, playing of videos, download offers for videos and slides, discussion form, peer assessments )
- The Operational costs including labour costs to run an MOOC site with 100s of courses and 100.000s of participants are minimal
- MOOC courses are designed to be reused in subsequent offerings of the course for which the instructor might not be involved. By this, the costs in time and effort for the content creators ( e.g. the lecturer of a university ) is limited. Some known popular design rules:
  - Avoiding references to particular dates in lecture videos (e.g., "The homework will be due next Monday, March 4" or "Itâ€™s a beautiful summer day today");
  - After the first offering of the course, systematically editing/removing references to dates and episodes that are specific to the first offering of the course (e.g., an announcement about correcting a typo on the final exam, or about extending due dates because of Hurricane Sandy), as well as references to activities for which instructor involvement is necessary (e.g., "We hope to see you at the next live Google+ Hangout").
- The price of a book about the same topic, especially with comparison of the amount of contents of a book and the MOOC course. In many cases, a book contains more informations than the videos and slides of a 4-week MOOC course.
- Is the MOOC course contents just another copy of contents available many times on other channels ( books, free online tutorials, vendor informations, knowledge gathered in a community Wiki ), or something exclusively new and unique?
